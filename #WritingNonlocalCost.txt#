1. BuildSearchTree -> BuildSearchHash (Multi-map)
2. Template parameter for DiscreteSearch to take different cost functionals
3. Run forward simuation to select g_hkl
4. Remove CSample that's being sent all over and replace it with a rotation matrix with SampleToLabMatrix
5. ProjectVoxel needs to be modified to include returned bbox and omega
6. Build a different cost function that uses images and grains - call this GrainCost
7. GrainLocalOptimization - using local optimization algorithms
   - use pointers to pass simulators and reconstruction with data
   - 

8. Need to be able to read data as binary or with intensity

9. Worry about plumbing when things actually work.  Wrost case - two binaries for now.
   - Need to branch in git

10 - first could do the dumber way - binary only

  Metric = sum of quality
