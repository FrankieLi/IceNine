#  Note that a coordinate system is chosen for these pixel.  Namely,
#  there's J and K.  The rationale is row, column, horizontal, vertical
#  becomes ambiguous for a detector that's rotated or are not mounted 
#  perpendicular to the beam.  Therefore, J and K are to be explicitly
#  specified in this file in the lab frame.  The orientation of the
#  detector is then the rotation that one must take from the specified 
#  J, K coordinate system to the experimental detector.
