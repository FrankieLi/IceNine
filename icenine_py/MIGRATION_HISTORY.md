# IceNine Python/PyTorch Migration History

Consolidated record of the C++ → Python/PyTorch migration. For current package usage, see [README.md](README.md).

## Migration Approach

- **Test-driven against C++ ground truth**: Every function validated against C++ output (tolerance < 1e-6). Ground truth generated via C++ test harnesses, stored as JSON in `cpp_outputs/`.
- **Dual-backend architecture**: `diffraction_core.py` supports both NumPy (backward compatible) and PyTorch (batched/GPU/autograd). Batched operations achieve 5-167x speedup over single-element processing.
- **Incremental porting**: Each module ported independently with its own test suite before integration.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Constants & Symmetry
- Ported `PhysicalConstants.h` → `constants.py`
- Crystal symmetry via pymatgen wrapper (`symmetry.py`), validated against 24 cubic rotation matrices

### Phase 2: Crystal Structure & Diffraction Physics
- `crystal_structure.py`: Reciprocal lattice generation, Miller index enumeration (136 reflections → 9 unique after cubic symmetry reduction)
- `diffraction_core.py`: Scattering vectors, Bragg condition, observable peaks. Full PyTorch autograd support for gradient-based orientation optimization.

### Phase 3: MIC File I/O & Spatial Indexing
- `mic_file.py`: Read/write `.mic` files (Bunge Euler angles in degrees on disk, rotation matrices in radians in memory). Validated against all 37 repository `.mic` files (268K voxels).
- Spatial indexing via `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` (radius queries, k-nearest, boundary detection). 10-100x faster than pure Python KDTree with identical API.

### Phase 4: Geometry & Simulation Range
- `geometry.py`: Euler conversions, Plane/Ray classes, refactored from mic_file.py for reuse
- `simulation_range.py`: Omega range system for discontinuous data collection wedges

### Phase 5: Detector & ImageData
- `detector.py` (~700 lines): DetectorParameters dataclass, differentiable coordinate transforms, ray-detector intersection
- `image_data.py` (~1075 lines): Dense/sparse tensor modes, soft/hard rasterization, differentiable overlap computation

### Phase 6: Sample, ConfigFile, ExperimentSetup
- `sample.py`: Sample class with critical Euler convention handling (see gotchas below)
- `config_file.py`: Parser for 80+ parameters across 10 categories with automatic degree-to-radian conversion
- `experiment_setup.py`, `file_io.py`: Experiment configuration and file I/O utilities

### Phase 7: Simulation & Forward Simulation
- `simulation.py`: Core simulation engine
- `forward_simulation.py`: Forward model implementation
- `peak_filters.py`: Peak filtering utilities
- Integration test framework in `Examples/Example2.ThreeVoxels/`

## Critical Gotchas

### Detector Geometry (Root Causes of Forward Simulation Mismatch)

Two bugs in detector geometry caused zero pixel overlap between Python and C++ forward simulation output. Fixing them achieved ~86% pixel match.

**Bug 1: Detector plane normal computed incorrectly** (`detector.py:_calculate_image_plane`)
- **C++ method** (`Detector.cpp:211-244 CalculateImagePlane`): Defines the detector plane using 3 corner points `(1,0,0)`, `(0,1,0)`, `(0,0,0)` rotated by the orientation matrix and translated by position. The plane normal is `cross(p2-p1, p3-p1)`.
- **Python bug**: Was computing plane normal as `cross(lab_basis_j, lab_basis_k)`, which gives the wrong normal when J/K unit vectors are not the standard basis (e.g., for typical HEDM detectors where J=`(1,0,0)` and K=`(0,-1,0)`).
- **Fix**: Replicated the C++ 3-point plane construction exactly.

**Bug 2: Detector J/K unit vectors hardcoded incorrectly** (`detector.py:__init__`)
- **C++ method** (`DetectorFile.cpp:GetDetector`): Reads `JUnitVector` and `KUnitVector` from the detector file and passes them to `SetImageParameter`.
- **Python bug**: Hardcoded J=`(0,1,0)`, K=`(0,0,1)` instead of reading from file. The correct defaults matching C++ convention are J=`(1,0,0)`, K=`(0,-1,0)`.
- **Fix**: Added `j_unit_vector`/`k_unit_vector` parameters to `Detector.__init__()` with correct defaults, and pass parsed values from `file_io.py:DetectorInfo.get_detector()`.

**Related fix in `file_io.py`**: `LabFrameOrientation` Euler angles were being double-converted from degrees to radians — `euler_to_matrix()` internally converts degrees, but the code was passing already-converted radians.

### Latent Bug: Sample orientation save/restore (degree/radian mismatch)
- `sample.get_orientation()` returns Euler angles in **radians**
- `sample.set_orientation()` expects angles in **degrees** (it calls `passive_euler_matrix()` which converts internally)
- C++ `SetOrientation` takes **radians** directly (calls `cosf()`)
- This bug doesn't trigger for the Example2 test case where orientation is `(0,0,0)`, but will break for non-zero sample orientations.

### Euler Angle Conventions
- **Voxel orientations**: Active ZXZ Bunge convention (standard crystallography)
- **Global sample orientation**: Passive Euler convention (`SetPassiveEulerMatrix` in C++), implemented as `passive_euler_matrix()` in Python. These are NOT the same — discovered through test failures.
- **Disk format**: `.mic` files store angles in **degrees**; conversion to radians happens at I/O boundaries.

### RNG Determinism
`GetRandomLocalGrid()` in C++ creates a local unseeded RNG per call, producing the same sequence each time. This behavior is preserved in the Python port — it may be intentional for reproducibility or an original oversight.

### Performance Requirements
Single-element physics operations are too slow for production. All diffraction calculations must use batched PyTorch operations for acceptable performance.

### Phase 8: Test Suite Hardening
Fixed all 12 test failures and 17 test errors to achieve a clean test suite (256 passed, 34 skipped, 0 failed, 0 errors).

**Bug fixes:**
- `symmetry.py`: `vectors_equivalent()` used `np.allclose` with default `rtol=1e-5`, causing the `tolerance` parameter to be ignored for large-magnitude vectors. Fixed by adding `rtol=0`.
- `experiment_setup.py`: Implemented `get_sample_symmetry()` (was returning `None`). Raises `NotImplementedError` for unsupported symmetry types (hexagonal).

**Test fixes:**
- `test_experiment_setup.py`: Added `chdir_to_project_root` fixture to match C++ CWD behavior for relative config paths. Tests that require data files (`omega_2L_100_cont.dat`) now skip gracefully.
- `test_simulation.py`: Fixed `get_reflections()` → `generate_reflections()` API mismatch, `r.g_vector` → `r.q_vec`.
- `test_experiment_setup.py`: Fixed `test_get_reciprocal_vector` to use actual beam direction from config (was hardcoded to `[0,0,1]`, config has `[1,0,0]`).
- `test_mic_file_validation.py`: Fixed histogram bins non-monotonic when `max(sizes)` is small.
- `test_diffraction.py`, `test_miller_indices.py`, `test_symmetry.py`: Added `pytest.skip` guards for missing C++ ground truth JSON files (previously caused `FileNotFoundError` errors).
- `test_miller_indices.py`, `test_symmetry.py`: Added `skipif` guards for optional `pytest-benchmark` dependency.

## Remaining Work

### Not Yet Ported
- Reconstruction algorithms (Reconstructor, BreadthFirstReconstructor, DiscreteAdaptive)
- Cost functions and search strategies
- Parallel processing (MPI-based server/client)
- Continuous optimization (ContinuousSearch)

### Integration Testing — Pixel-Exact Match Achieved

C++ vs Python forward simulation comparison using three-voxel test case (360 detector images, 2 detectors, 180 omega steps, copper FCC).

**Final status:** 3200/3201 pixels match at identical locations with max relative intensity difference of 5.4e-6. Only 4 pixel-location mismatches remain, all caused by floating-point omega values landing on bin boundaries (rounding to adjacent 1° bin).

**Bug fix history (chronological):**
1. Detector plane normal computed incorrectly → fixed to match C++ 3-point construction
2. J/K unit vectors hardcoded wrong → fixed to read from detector file
3. `LabFrameOrientation` Euler angles double-converted → fixed to pass degrees to `euler_to_matrix()`
4. Voxel vertices used hardcoded 1mm right triangle → fixed to use actual equilateral triangle geometry from .mic file (side_length, points_up, position), matching C++ `MicIO.h:300-315`
5. **Rasterization mismatch (4.3x extra pixels)**: Python used soft/sigmoid rasterization. Replaced with C++-matching scanline rasterizer: float→int truncation matching `ToRowPixel`/`ToColPixel`, Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping with C++ boundary conventions, Bresenham edge table, scanline fill. Reduced from 4.3x → 1.36x pixel ratio.
6. **Multi-detector short-circuit**: Implemented C++ `GetProjectedVertices` behavior — if ANY vertex fails to intersect ANY detector plane, skip ALL detectors for that peak. (No effect on Example2 since all rays hit both detector planes.)
7. **C++ tokenizer bug (`Parser.cpp`)**: `Tokenize()` dropped the last line of files without trailing newlines. The mic file `three_voxels.mic` had no trailing `\n`, so the 3rd voxel was silently skipped — C++ only simulated 2 of 3 voxels. Fixed by treating end-of-buffer as implicit newline. This was the root cause of the remaining 843 extra pixels (Python correctly loaded all 3 voxels).

**Key implementation details (for future debugging):**
- `image_data.py:add_triangle_scanline()` — C++-matching rasterizer. Vertex coordinates are truncated (not rounded) to match `ToRowPixel`/`ToColPixel`. Clipping uses `x < x_max` (strictly less) for right/bottom and `x >= x_min` for left/top, matching C++ `SutherlandHodgman.h`.
- `simulation.py:project_voxel_multi_detector()` — Projects all 3 vertices onto all detectors before rasterizing. Short-circuits if any vertex misses any detector plane.
- `forward_simulation.py:_simulate_peaks()` — Triple loop: voxels × reflections × omega solutions. Uses `range_map.angle_to_wedge_index()` for omega bin mapping. Peak filter (`XDMEtaAcceptFn`) applies Lorentz-polarization correction: `I = I_form / (|sin(η)| × sin(2θ))`.
- Omega-to-bin mapping: `SimulationRange._build_index_list()` marks only the CENTER bin of each wedge, matching C++ `SimulationData.h:Set()`. For 180 individual 1° wedges, all 180 bins have valid indices.

### Performance Optimization — 6x Forward Simulation Speedup

Profiling the ManyGrains test (24,570 voxels, 112 reflections, 180 omega steps) revealed torch scalar operation overhead as the bottleneck. Each per-element torch tensor op has ~10-50µs Python overhead; with ~3,360 torch ops per voxel this dominated runtime at ~58ms/voxel (~22min total).

**Optimizations applied:**
1. **Batched Bragg solving**: Single `get_scattering_omegas_torch()` call per voxel with all reflections stacked as (N,3) tensor, instead of N individual calls
2. **Pre-computed detector geometry**: Detector plane normals, origins, unit vectors, and pixel parameters extracted as plain Python floats before the voxel loop
3. **Pure-Python inner loop**: Replaced torch scalar tensor ops with `math` module for rotation, ray-plane intersection, and lab-to-pixel conversion
4. **Functional rotation**: Compute Rz(omega) @ base_rotation as inline float math instead of mutating/restoring sample state per omega

**Result**: 9.3ms/voxel (down from 58.2ms), ~4.5min for full ManyGrains simulation.

**ManyGrains validation**: 99.97% pixel match rate (7,422,506 / 7,424,450), pixel count ratio 1.0000, total intensity ratio 1.000000, mean correlation 0.9996. Remaining ~0.03% mismatches are omega bin-boundary rounding (same as ThreeVoxels).

**Note on differentiability**: The inner loop now uses plain floats (not torch autograd). This is acceptable because forward simulation generates images for comparison and doesn't need gradients. The proper differentiable path would batch ALL voxels into large tensors (matrix ops on thousands of voxels simultaneously), which is a separate effort.
